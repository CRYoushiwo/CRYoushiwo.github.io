# About Me

<img src="https://CRYoushiwo.github.io/ChangrongYou.png" class="floatpic" width="421" height="512">

Here is **Changrong You (Pekko, 游昌榕)**.

I am a junior student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at Xidian University. Currently, I am in the process of learning the fundamental concepts of Computer Vision. As a newcomer to the field of computer vision and a novice blogger, I plan to maintain a long-term record of my growth journey, including, but not limited to, project experiences, course studies, and daily life. I warmly welcome you to visit my little corner of the internet and engage in further discussions with me.

## Research Interests

- Medical Image Processing
- Rich Text Generation
- Combining Knowledge Graph with LLM

My current focus lies primarily in the realm of medical image processing, a choice largely driven by my **long-standing passion for medicine**. However, I am equally enthusiastic about exploring other research directions.

If you share an interest in any of these areas, please feel free to book an [[online talk with me](https://calendly.com/cryoushiwo/meet-me-at-midnight)].
